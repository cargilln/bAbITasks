# bAbITasks
Designed a chat-bot using the Slack application (Slack API) in order to reply to Facebook's bAbI tasks (https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/).
Used the training data offered by Facebook in order to train my model.  Used spaCy in order tokenize words and work with Natural Language Processing.
